## Introduction

Diamonds are a remarkable form of carbon with a crystal structure known as diamond cubic. They possess unique properties such as extreme hardness and excellent thermal conductivity, making them valuable in various industrial applications, including cutting and polishing tools. The ability to withstand high pressure also allows diamonds to be used in diamond anvil cells for scientific research.

## Diamonds Dataset

The Diamonds dataset is a classic dataset that contains information about nearly 54,000 diamonds. It serves as an excellent resource for machine learning, data analysis, and visualization. This dataset includes various attributes of diamonds, allowing us to explore their characteristics and predict their prices.

## Dataset Columns

Here are the columns in the Diamonds dataset along with their descriptions:

- **price:** Price of the diamond in US dollars ($326 - $18,823)
- **carat:** Weight of the diamond (0.2 - 5.01)
- **cut:** Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
- **color:** Diamond color, graded from J (worst) to D (best)
- **clarity:** Measurement of the diamond's clarity (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
- **x:** Length of the diamond in millimeters (0 - 10.74)
- **y:** Width of the diamond in millimeters (0 - 58.9)
- **z:** Depth of the diamond in millimeters (0 - 31.8)
- **depth:** Total depth percentage (43 - 79)
- **table:** Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point (43 - 95)

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. By leveraging the Diamonds dataset and various data analysis techniques, we aim to gain insights into the factors that influence diamond prices and build an accurate prediction model.
